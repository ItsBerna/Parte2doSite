        Baby, I'm a broken man
    I'm just a shattering storm
    Baby, try to find my way
    As the lonely shadows swarm
    
    Whoa whoa whoa, I'm just a man
    Missing you, please understand
    Without you-ou-ou, I'm dying
    
    No, no one will know how I bear my pain alone
    In the end, I choose my solitude
    No, I can't go back to my days of innocence
    Can't go back, there is no return
    
    Another cycle of seasons has passed us by and I can't help
    I wonder, I wonder, I wonder just where you are now
    I hear from everyone that you are different
    And that you are yet more beautiful than before
    
    Whoa whoa
    
    If you say that you are happier now
    And that's just the way you feel about everything now
    Well then I guess it's just the way
    That it is

    Hey now, here is my song
    For you, yeah, that's right.
    I wish that I was yours,
    But I'm too shy, I suppose.

    If only I could just conjure a spell.
    Kapow! Hocus, hocus, hocus!
    Then you and I would be
    Together for all time, I suppose.

    Is it love that makes my heart go
    Boom, boom, boom?
    Yeah, I suppose!
    Love you, love you, love you!

    More than yesterday...
    I suppose!
    Hey now, sing it to me!
    That's right, I'm talking to you!
	  
    I hope that this message finds you
    Feeling ever so wonderful!
    I just can't hold it back anymore!
    Yeah! Love you, love you, love you!

    If only we could stay just like this.
    You are so wonderful!
    I never felt like this, my heart going
    Boom, boom, boom!

    It's wonderful!
    Love you, love you, love you!
    Even more than before!
    Wonderful!
